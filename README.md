GeoJSON-Football
================

[GeoJSON](http://geojson.org) of American Football Stadiums

Inspired by cageyjames and his [GeoJSON](https://github.com/cageyjames/GeoJSON-Ballparks) of baseball stadiums, I've started a GeoJSON of American Football stadiums.

Included as of now:
  1. All current [NFL](http://nfl.com) stadiums
  
Future Plans:
  1. All stadiums used for international games on regular basis
  2. Past stadiums of current NFL teams
  3. Past stadiums of defunct NFL teams
  4. More info about the stadiums themselves
  
Way down the line...
  1. GeoJSON of NCAA teams?
